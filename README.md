# Subseries-Search
Algorithm to perform subseries and subsequence matching. Where in a list of series of numerical values, T, containing n x n length series, such as T =< T1, T2, ..., Tn > and a reference series of numerical values, S, of length k, where k > n, what is the subseries of S that is the closest match to a series in T? For example, S =< 1, 2, 9 > is a subseries of T1 =< 1, 7, 2, 1, 2, 9, 4 > where S appears as a contiguous block in T1 starting at position 4.
